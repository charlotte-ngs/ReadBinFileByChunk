## Background

In an earlier [posts](http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/rgrm/rgrmhelperfunctions.html) I showed some functions to work with symmetric matrices that are read from binary files using R's `readBin()` function. The use case presented in the earlier post was a genetic relationship matrix. The approach chosen at that time was to first read all lower triangular elemnts including the diagonal of the matrix into a vector. Based on some characteristics of symmetric matrices, we were able to trace back elements from the vector into the original matrix.
